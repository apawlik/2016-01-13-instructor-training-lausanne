<h2>Workshop description</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
This workshop covers the basics of educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to use these ideas 
in both intensive workshops and regular classes. The workshop is a mix of lectures and hand-on lessons where you 
practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss.
This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not need any particular technical background, 
and we will not be teaching that.This workshop is based on the constantly revised and updated
 <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/">curriculum</a>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at everyone who is interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular,
  this trainig is aimed at those who want to become Software and Data Carpentry instructors, run
  workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training materials.
<p><strong>You don't have to be currently an instructor or a teacher to attend this workshop. But you do need to be
 willing and committed to become one and to improve your teaching techniques. </strong></p>
</p>

  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Modify the block below if there are any special requirements.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> 
  Participants should bring a laptop that is Internet connected and has a functioning browser. 
  If you have it, a specialized device for recording audio and video 
  (mobile phones and laptops are OK) - throughout the two days, 
  we are going to record one another teaching in pairs or threes. 
  It does not have to be high-quality, 
 but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

  <p><em>Also, make sure you read the
    <a href="#preparation">Preparation</a> section below.</em> You will also receive some further 
   information before the workshop so please check your email.</p>

   All paricipants are also required to abide by
  Software Carpentry's <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

        which is a nice overview of things that <em>are not</em> true, but are widely believed.

    <li>Please also pick up a copy of <a target="_blank"

        going of research in education. It is full of useful insights, and a lot of how we teach is based on the
